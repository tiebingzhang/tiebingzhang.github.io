Today I learned that the difference between `uv tool install` vs `uv tool run` which is the same as `uvx`. The former
installs thing permanently for you, under a directory where you can find with the command `uv tool dir` (on macOS, it's `~/.local/share/uv/tools`). The latter also installs things in the uv cache dir, which you can find with the command `uv cache dir` (on macOS, it's `~/.cache/uv/`). You can use the `uv cache size/prune/clean` to manage the cache.  You may want to watch for your cache size so that it doesn't bloat too big because of all the one-time python command you ran in the past. I believe there is a way to set a max cache size. 

So looks like `uv tool` is a good tool to manage python packages that comes with cli tools that you just want to use as
a normal cli. in this case, it manages all the venv for you and added to your PATH env nicely and automatically. 

Also a big shoutout to the [parakeet-mlx](https://github.com/senstella/parakeet-mlx) tool that allows you to do speech-to-text on your mac and output `.rst` files
with timestamps.
