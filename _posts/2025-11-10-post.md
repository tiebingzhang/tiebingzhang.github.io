> I realized today why many teens self-harm (body-cutting, etc). It's self-medication. Their mental state felt so stuck.
They are trapped in negative thoughts, rumination, and brooding. A good way to snap out of it is to have some strong
physical external shocks to their body (hopefully non-harmful). A quick run in the outdoor works. A cold shower. Jumping
into a cold pool or river or the ocean.  However, many times they do not have the motivation to do that since it takes
energy/effort to do it. On the other hand, self-harming is likely one of the most accessible ways to provide that needed
shock to relieve from the trapped negative state. This is similar to why many people drink accohol. It's self
medication. 

With this realization, if parents can provide their teens with other less-harmful shocking mechanism above, maybe there
will be less self-harming.  


I realized that even forceful and consicious breathing can help, and that can be done anywhere anytime.
