The more people who witness an incident, the less likely it is that someone will intervene—that’s the power of the Bystander Effect. It can happen for a few reasons.

1. Observing people who witness an incident but do not intervene can cause someone to *assume that the behavior is acceptable* and they’re the only one who is uncomfortable. 

2. When many people observe a potentially harmful or unprofessional situation, individuals *feel less personal responsibility* to intervene. They may assume that, with so many people around, surely someone else will help. 

3. Bystanders often wait in confusion to see if someone else will intervene. This is a natural response, but it doesn’t mean the impacted person doesn’t need help.
