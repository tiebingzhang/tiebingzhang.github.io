We all know exercise is good for us, but here is my epiphany today: the reason might not be the workout itself —- it's the fresh oxygen flooding our system.

Think about it. The activities that make us feel most alive—hiking, swimming, skiing, even a simple walk—all happen outdoors. That's not a coincidence.


### The indoor crisis

The average person spends 90% of their time indoors, breathing air that with higher CO2 levels that literally make us think slower.  Studies show just 90 minutes in nature reduces activity in our brain's *rumination* center, the part that keeps us stuck in negative thought loops. Meanwhile, prolonged indoor time increases depression risk by 60%.

When we exercise outdoors, we're not just burning calories. We're:

- Supercharging our mitochondria with oxygen
- Bathing in negative ions from natural environments
- Absorbing phytoncides from trees that boost immune function
- Breaking the rumination cycle that indoor living enables

Research proves that "green exercise" outperforms indoor workouts for mood, energy, and cognitive function.

### Start small

- Morning oxygen boost: 5 minutes outside stretching
- Lunch break reset: Walk around the block 
- Evening wind-down: 10 minutes of outdoor breathing before bed

#### Level up

- Exercise outdoors at least 3x per week
- Work near an open window when possible
- Take calls while walking outside
- Eat one meal outdoors daily
