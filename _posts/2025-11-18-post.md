After reading Simon Willison's [recent blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/18/gemini-3/) on his new pelican-riding-bicycle llm test and seeing the unsatisfactory results from GPT 5.1 and Sonnet 4.5, I decided to try it on Opus 4.1. Here is what it looks like:![pelican](images/opus-4.1-pelican.svg)

I would say that looks reall good to me!

And here is the prompt I gave it:
```
Generate an SVG of a California brown pelican riding a bicycle. The bicycle must have spokes and a correctly shaped bicycle frame. The pelican must have its characteristic large pouch, and there should be a clear indication of feathers. The pelican must be clearly pedaling the bicycle. The image should show the full breeding plumage of the California brown pelican.
```
